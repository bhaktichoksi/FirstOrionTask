Steps that I have followed to complete this task:
------------------------------------------------
Downloaded latest Android-studio and updated latest SDK in to project
Configured Kotlin dependencies and created a project module
Worked on MVVM coding structure
Parsed Json API using Retrofit in kotlin
Created a recycler adapter and bind all items using view holder pattern
Displayed all data as per the UI provided in a document

Tasks:
-----
a. List of all the Posts – the main screen
Parsed all Users data from this link "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" using retrofit API.
Stored all data using shared prefernces so that no need to call API multiple times.

b. User details (combined with the Post info) – when a Post is clicked
Created floating action button for a new Fragment which will be created when a Post is clicked.

c. Create a new Post – allows users to create and upload a new Post.
I have given validations and used fake API to post user data into main page. 
I got a link from this site - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/
and I have used "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" API and pass all the parameters using 
POST method and with this 'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8'

Note: For posting a data, I have checked into postman and I successfully got a JSON response after creating a post.
However, It was not reflecting into main POST API as I have read on a site that;
"resource will not be really updated on the server but it will be faked as if"

Build an APK which is attached in this zip file.

Thank You
